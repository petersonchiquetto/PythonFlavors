## 👨‍🍳 PythonFlavors: A Dive into OOP with Python 🐍

Welcome to PythonFlavors! 🍽️ This repository is your practical guide to mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python by building a restaurant system. Immerse yourself in the essential concepts of OOP with delicious and practical examples, while exploring the architecture and technical nuances of Python.

## Flavors of OOP in Python 😋

### ⚙️ Project Architecture

The PythonFlavors project has been carefully structured to illustrate the principles of OOP in a clear and didactic way. Each module represents a fundamental part of the restaurant system, making it easy to understand and expand the code.

* `models.py`: Contains the classes that represent the restaurant entities, such as `Customer`, `Waiter`, and `Dish`, along with their respective attributes and methods.
* `services.py`: Defines the classes that implement the restaurant's business logic, such as `Order` and `Menu`, which interact with the models to perform operations.
* `interface.py`: (Optional) Contains classes to create a user interface, whether text-based or graphical, to interact with the system.

### 🧩 Classes

Understand how to model real-world entities, such as `Customer`, `Waiter`, and `Dish`, using classes and their attributes. Each class is defined with its own methods, which represent the actions that objects can perform.

### 🔗 Inheritance

Discover how to create specialized classes, such as `VIPCustomer`, which inherit characteristics from more general classes, such as `Customer`, and add specific functionalities. Inheritance promotes code reuse and the hierarchical organization of classes.

### ✨ Polymorphism

Learn to use polymorphism to treat objects of different classes uniformly, such as when processing orders from regular and VIP customers. Polymorphism allows you to write more generic and flexible code.

### 🔒 Encapsulation

Protect the data of your classes from unwanted external access, ensuring the integrity of your system. Encapsulation allows you to control access to the attributes of classes, preventing accidental or incorrect modifications.
